# Project Title

Responsive Build Out

## Project Description

This is a daily assignment from The Iron Yard using responsive web design.

### Things to know

This project used a mobile-first approach. I first designed the site to the mobile mockup. Upon completing that, I added a media query for tablets, and made all of the necessary adjustments. Then, I used a media query for desktop browsers, and made the remaining adjustments. Flex-box was used for this project, and minimal adjustments were needed for the media queries.
